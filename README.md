# Basic commands

- run visualization - `make vis`
- flash simulator - `make flash-simulator`
- flash reference controller - `make flash-sample-controller`

For these commands, you have to open and build the project within the directory `controller` with `stm32cubeide` at least once.

- build & flash - `make flash` (not guaranteed that it works reliably)
